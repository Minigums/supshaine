Highly doubt anyone will ever stumble upon my github but yay if you for some reason reading this

Lil project I made for my crush for 2024 valentines, theres a inside joke in my Eng class about me searching up everything on Urban Dictionary, so I remade Urban Dictionary's website and defining my crush's name

also this repository is public cus I need it for the pages thing so yah :)

ps it ended up failing and also I realized I never changed the description from the html file i downloaded so it was a disaster when I sent it out to her D:
